A simple terminal based music player built in C++ using a  linked list.  
Each song is represented as a node. You can add songs, play them, skip to the next, or delete them all from the console.

## Features

- Add songs  
- Play the current song  
- Skip to the next song  
- Remove a song  
- Display all songs in the playlist

## How to Run

1\. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C++ IDE  
2\. Compile and run "music_player.cpp" or "main.cpp" 
3\. Use the terminal interface to manage your playlist
If it runs without errors, congrats!  
If it crashes.. well, debugging is part of the fun.

## Future Plans

- Shuffle mode  
- Repeat current song
